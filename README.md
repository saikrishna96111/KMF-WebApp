This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Firebase setup and build-safe initialization

- Firebase is configured through environment variables (see `.env.example`). During build time and server-side rendering the Firebase SDK should not be initialized unless the API key is present. To avoid build failures (for example, `auth/invalid-api-key`), this project only initializes Firebase on the client when the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` variable is set.

- If you want to deploy this project to Vercel and use Firebase, add the following Environment Variables under Settings > Environment Variables:
	- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
	- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
	- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
	- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
	- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
	- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

- For local development copy `.env.example` -> `.env.local` and add your Firebase values. The application will gracefully handle missing Firebase settings during SSR by not initializing the SDK and showing an appropriate client-side message.
